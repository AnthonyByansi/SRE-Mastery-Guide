# Exercise 2: On-Call Incident Simulation

In this exercise, you will simulate an on-call incident scenario where you are responsible for handling a critical incident that arises during your on-call shift. This exercise will test your ability to respond to real-time incidents and manage them effectively.

## Scenario

You are the on-call SRE responsible for maintaining the availability and reliability of a popular e-commerce website. During your on-call shift, you receive a notification indicating a service outage affecting a significant portion of users. Your task is to initiate an incident response, investigate the issue, and restore service as quickly as possible.

## Instructions

1. When you receive the incident notification, promptly acknowledge it and confirm the details of the incident.

2. Initiate the incident response process, including:
   - Notifying relevant team members and stakeholders.
   - Accessing monitoring and logging tools to gather information.
   - Identifying the root cause of the incident.

3. Document your actions and findings in real-time as the incident progresses.

4. Take corrective actions to restore service functionality. This may involve making configuration changes, restarting services, or implementing temporary workarounds.

5. Continuously communicate with team members and stakeholders to provide updates on the incident's status and progress.

6. Once the service is restored, conduct a brief post-incident analysis to identify the root cause and discuss preventive measures.

7. Write an incident report summarizing the incident, response actions, root cause analysis, and recommendations for future incident prevention and response.

## Submission

Create a markdown file (e.g., `exercise2-on-call-incident.md`) and document your on-call incident response process, actions taken, post-incident analysis, and incident report. Commit this file to your repository.
