## Introduction

Monitoring and alerting are essential practices in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). This module explores the importance of monitoring, key concepts, monitoring tools, alerting strategies, and includes a hands-on exercise to set up monitoring and alerts.

## Importance of Monitoring and Alerting

Effective monitoring and alerting enable SREs to:
- Proactively detect issues before they impact users.
- Gain insights into system performance.
- Track key metrics and indicators.
- Respond quickly to incidents.
- Ensure service reliability and availability.

## Key Concepts

### Metrics

Metrics provide quantitative data about system behavior. Common metrics include response times, error rates, and resource utilization. Metrics help in assessing the health and performance of systems.

### Logging

Logging involves recording events and data relevant to system operations. Logs can be used for troubleshooting, auditing, and analysis. Structured logs provide valuable insights.

### Tracing

Tracing allows tracking a request's journey through a distributed system. It helps diagnose performance issues and understand dependencies between components.

## Monitoring Tools

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring solution for Azure services. It provides metrics, logs, and insights into the performance of Azure resources.

### Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system, and Grafana is a visualization and alerting platform. Together, they provide a powerful solution for monitoring and alerting.

## Alerting Strategies

### Setting Up Alerts

Define alerts based on predefined thresholds or anomaly detection. Configure notifications to notify on-call responders when issues arise.

### Incident Management

Establish clear incident management processes to address alerts effectively. Define roles and responsibilities for incident responders, and track incidents through resolution.

## Exercise: Setting Up Monitoring and Alerts

In this exercise, you will set up basic monitoring and alerts for a sample application. You will use a monitoring tool of your choice (e.g., Azure Monitor or Prometheus/Grafana) to collect and visualize metrics, set up alerts, and practice incident response.

> Instructions for the exercise can be found in the [Exercise: Setting Up Monitoring and Alerts](./exercise-monitoring-alerts.md) document.

## Conclusion

Monitoring and alerting are foundational practices for ensuring the reliability of systems. They empower SREs to detect, respond to, and resolve issues swiftly. In the upcoming modules, we will explore more advanced monitoring scenarios and strategies.
