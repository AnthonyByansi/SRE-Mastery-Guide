## Introduction

Understanding the fundamentals of cloud computing is essential for any Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) working in a cloud-based environment. This module provides an overview of cloud computing concepts with a specific focus on Microsoft Azure.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the internet (the cloud) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Cloud providers, like Microsoft Azure, offer a wide range of services that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services efficiently.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing offers numerous benefits, including scalability, cost-efficiency, flexibility, and reduced operational burden. SREs leverage these advantages to enhance system reliability and availability.

## Azure Cloud Overview

### Azure Services

Azure provides a vast ecosystem of services, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Understanding the range of services available is crucial for tailoring solutions to specific SRE needs.

### Azure Resource Management

Azure employs a robust system for managing cloud resources, allowing SREs to provision, monitor, and control resources efficiently.

## Azure Fundamentals

### Azure Subscriptions

Azure subscriptions provide access to Azure products, services, and features. Understanding how to manage subscriptions is foundational for SREs.

### Resource Groups

Resource groups are containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. They help manage and organize resources effectively.

### Azure Regions

Azure is hosted in datacenters worldwide, organized into regions. SREs need to comprehend Azure's geographical distribution for redundancy and disaster recovery planning.

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

ARM is Azure's management framework that enables SREs to deploy, manage, and monitor resources consistently.

## Implementing Cloud Fundamentals in SRE

SREs utilize Azure's cloud services to build resilient systems. They deploy applications across multiple Azure regions for high availability, utilize Azure DevOps for continuous integration and delivery, and leverage Azure's monitoring and alerting tools to ensure reliability.

## Conclusion

This module has introduced fundamental cloud computing concepts and Azure-specific knowledge that SREs need to excel in managing cloud-based systems. In the next phases, we will delve deeper into SRE practices within the Azure environment.
