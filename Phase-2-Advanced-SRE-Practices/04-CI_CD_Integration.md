## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are fundamental practices in modern Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). This module explores the concepts of CI/CD, its benefits, implementation strategies, key tools, and best practices for enhancing system reliability.

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD refers to a set of practices that automate the integration, testing, and deployment of code changes to production. It enables teams to deliver new features, updates, and fixes quickly and reliably.

## Benefits of CI/CD

CI/CD offers several advantages, including faster release cycles, reduced manual interventions, improved code quality, and enhanced system reliability. SREs leverage CI/CD to maintain service availability while introducing changes.

## Implementing CI/CD in SRE

SREs play a crucial role in integrating CI/CD into the development and operations workflows. This integration ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested and reliably deployed to production without causing disruptions.

## Key CI/CD Tools

### Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps provides a comprehensive set of tools for implementing CI/CD pipelines, including code repositories, build automation, testing, and release management.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD solution tightly integrated with GitHub repositories, enabling seamless automation of software development workflows.

## CI/CD Best Practices

### Pipeline Automation

Automate the entire CI/CD pipeline, from code commits to production deployment, to ensure consistency and reliability.

### Testing Automation

Implement automated testing practices, including unit, integration, and acceptance tests, to catch issues early in the development process.

### Release Management

Use automated release management to coordinate and monitor deployments, enabling easy rollback in case of issues.

## Exercise: CI/CD Integration

In this exercise, you will set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for a sample application using a CI/CD tool of your choice (e.g., Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions). You will automate code building, testing, and deployment to a staging environment.

> Instructions for the exercise can be found in the [Exercise: CI/CD Integration](./exercise-ci-cd-integration.md) document.

## Conclusion

CI/CD integration is a vital practice for SREs to balance the introduction of new features and maintain system reliability. In the following modules, we will explore more advanced CI/CD scenarios and challenges.
