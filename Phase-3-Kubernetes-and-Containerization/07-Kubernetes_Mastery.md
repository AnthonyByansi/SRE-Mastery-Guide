## Introduction

Kubernetes has become a cornerstone technology for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) managing containerized applications. This module explores the role of Kubernetes in SRE, key concepts, components, scaling strategies, and its integration with Azure.

## Why Kubernetes in SRE

Kubernetes provides SREs with:
- Container orchestration for deploying and managing applications.
- Automatic scaling to handle traffic spikes.
- High availability and fault tolerance.
- Simplified application updates and rollbacks.
- Seamless integration with cloud services.

## Key Kubernetes Concepts

### Pods

Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers. They share the same network namespace and storage, facilitating communication.

### Deployments

Deployments define how applications should run, including the desired number of replicas and update strategies. They ensure application availability and manage rolling updates.

### Services

Kubernetes Services abstract network endpoints, making it easy to expose applications internally or externally. They provide load balancing and DNS resolution.

## Kubernetes Components

### Kubelet

Kubelet is the Kubernetes agent responsible for running and managing containers on each node in the cluster.

### Kube Proxy

Kube Proxy maintains network rules for pods. It enables pod-to-pod communication and load balancing.

### etcd

etcd is a distributed key-value store used for storing cluster configuration and state data.

## Scaling and High Availability

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

HPA automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization metrics. It ensures optimal resource allocation.

### Load Balancing

Kubernetes provides built-in load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple pods for high availability.

## Kubernetes in Azure

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

AKS is a managed Kubernetes service in Azure, simplifying cluster management, scaling, and updates.

### Integration with Azure Services

Kubernetes can seamlessly integrate with Azure services like Azure Monitor, Azure Container Registry, and more.

## Exercise: Deploying and Scaling Applications in Kubernetes

In this exercise, you will deploy a sample application to a Kubernetes cluster, configure scaling based on resource metrics, and explore high availability strategies. This hands-on experience will deepen your understanding of Kubernetes in action.

> Instructions for the exercise can be found in the [Exercise: Deploying and Scaling Applications in Kubernetes](./exercise-kubernetes-deployment.md) document.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes mastery is a significant asset for SREs, enabling efficient management of containerized applications and ensuring high availability. In the next modules, we will delve into advanced Kubernetes scenarios and best practices.
