## Introduction

Security and compliance are paramount in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) within Azure. This module explores security best practices, compliance standards, and Azure tools to help SREs protect assets and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.

## Security Best Practices

### Identity and Access Management

Effective identity and access management (IAM) restricts access to resources, enforces least privilege, and ensures secure authentication and authorization.

### Network Security

Network security measures, including firewalls, network segmentation, and intrusion detection, safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Data Protection

Data protection strategies, such as encryption, data masking, and backup and recovery plans, secure sensitive information from threats.

## Compliance Standards

### Azure Compliance Offerings

Azure offers a wide range of compliance certifications and attestations, ensuring adherence to global standards and regulations.

### Industry-Specific Compliance

Industry-specific compliance standards, such as HIPAA for healthcare or PCI DSS for payment card industry, may apply to your Azure deployments.

## Azure Security and Compliance Tools

### Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center provides threat protection, security monitoring, and advanced threat detection across Azure resources.

### Azure Policy

Azure Policy allows you to enforce organizational standards and assess compliance with automated policy controls.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor enables you to gain insights into resource performance and detect security threats using advanced monitoring capabilities.

## Exercise: Implementing Azure Security and Compliance Policies

In this exercise, you will implement security and compliance policies for your Azure resources. You will use Azure Policy and Azure Security Center to enforce security controls and assess compliance.

Instructions for the exercise can be found in the [Exercise: Implementing Azure Security and Compliance Policies](./exercise-security-compliance.md) document.

## Conclusion

Security and compliance are integral to Azure SRE, ensuring the protection of assets and alignment with regulatory requirements. In the next modules, we will explore advanced Azure SRE scenarios and best practices.
