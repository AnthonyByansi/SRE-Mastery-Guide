# Exercise 1: Incident Response Simulation

In this exercise, you will participate in a simulated incident response scenario to apply your incident management skills. The goal is to practice detecting, responding to, and analyzing incidents effectively. 

## Scenario

You are a member of the incident response team for a critical online service. Today, you receive an alert indicating a sudden spike in error rates and latency. Your task is to follow the incident management process to mitigate the issue and conduct a post-incident analysis.

## Instructions

1. Begin by reviewing the alert and assessing the severity of the incident.

2. Initiate communication with team members using your preferred communication tool (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.).

3. As a team, discuss the incident, gather information, and decide on the appropriate actions to take.

4. Document your incident response steps, including actions taken, communications made, and any escalations if necessary.

5. Once the incident is resolved, conduct a post-incident analysis. Identify the root cause of the issue and discuss preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.

6. Write a brief incident report summarizing the incident, response actions, root cause analysis, and recommended improvements.

## Submission

Create a markdown file (e.g., `exercise1-incident-response.md`) and document your incident response process, post-incident analysis, and incident report. Commit this file to your repository.
