## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a fundamental practice in modern Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). This module explores the concept of IaC, its benefits, key tools, best practices, and its application within the Azure ecosystem.

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation. It enables SREs to define and configure infrastructure resources as code, ensuring consistency and repeatability.

## Benefits of IaC

IaC offers several advantages, including repeatability, automation, version control, scalability, and improved collaboration. SREs leverage IaC to streamline infrastructure management and enhance system reliability.

## IaC Tools

### Terraform

Terraform is an open-source IaC tool that allows SREs to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language. Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers, including Azure.

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates

ARM templates are Azure-specific IaC templates used to define and deploy Azure resources. These templates are written in JSON and enable precise control over Azure infrastructure.

## IaC Best Practices

### Version Control

Managing IaC code in version control systems like Git provides traceability, collaboration, and rollback capabilities.

### Modularity

Creating modular IaC code promotes reusability and maintainability, making it easier to manage complex infrastructures.

### Testing

Implementing testing practices for IaC code helps identify issues early, ensuring that the deployed infrastructure meets reliability standards.

## Implementing IaC in Azure

SREs can use Terraform or ARM templates to implement IaC in Azure. These tools enable the automated provisioning and management of Azure resources, aligning with SRE principles for reliability and scalability.

## Conclusion

IaC is a fundamental practice for SREs working in cloud-based environments like Azure. It enhances infrastructure reliability, repeatability, and scalability. In the following phases, we will delve deeper into specific IaC implementations and scenarios.
