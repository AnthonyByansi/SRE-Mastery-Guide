# Exercise 2: Error Budget Management

In this exercise, you will explore the concept of error budgets, a crucial element of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Error budgets help balance the delivery of new features with maintaining system reliability.

## Instructions

1. Assume that your team has defined an Error Budget Policy for a critical web service, allowing for a maximum of 10 hours of unavailability per month.

2. Analyze the recent performance data for the web service and calculate the current error budget status. For example, if there have been 5 hours of unavailability this month, you have used 50% of the error budget.

3. Consider different scenarios: 
   - If the error budget is not exhausted, what actions can your team take to improve the service or release new features?
   - If the error budget is close to being exhausted or already exhausted, how should your team prioritize reliability over new features?

4. Document your findings, calculations, and recommendations regarding error budget management.
