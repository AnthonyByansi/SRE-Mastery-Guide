## Introduction

Incident management is a critical aspect of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). This module explores the importance of incident management, key concepts, incident management tools, the incident management process, and includes a hands-on exercise to simulate incident response.

## Importance of Incident Management

Effective incident management enables SREs to:
- Minimize service downtime.
- Prevent recurring incidents.
- Improve system reliability.
- Enhance user experience.
- Learn from incidents to prevent future failures.

## Key Incident Management Concepts

### Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on their impact and urgency. Clear incident classification helps prioritize responses and allocate resources efficiently.

### Incident Response

Incident response involves timely identification, containment, and resolution of incidents. Well-defined response procedures are crucial for quick recovery.

### Post-Incident Review

Post-incident reviews (PIRs) are conducted to analyze incidents, identify root causes, and implement preventive measures. PIRs contribute to continuous improvement.

## Incident Management Tools

### Incident Tracking Systems

Incident tracking systems help in documenting and tracking incidents, including their status, actions taken, and resolution details.

### Communication Tools

Effective communication tools facilitate real-time collaboration among incident responders, ensuring timely updates and coordination.

## Incident Management Process

### Incident Detection and Notification

Incident detection involves monitoring systems for anomalies and generating alerts. Notifications ensure the incident response team is informed promptly.

### Incident Triage

Triage assesses the incident's impact, urgency, and severity. It guides the assignment of resources and sets the incident's priority.

### Incident Resolution

Incident resolution focuses on restoring service functionality as quickly as possible while minimizing customer impact.

### Post-Incident Analysis

Post-incident analysis identifies root causes, documents lessons learned, and defines preventive actions to avoid similar incidents.

## Exercise: Simulated Incident Response

In this exercise, you will participate in a simulated incident response scenario. You will practice incident detection, response, and post-incident analysis. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in handling incidents effectively.

> Instructions for the exercise can be found in the [Exercise: Simulated Incident Response](./exercise-incident-response.md) document.

## Conclusion

Incident management is a core practice for SREs to maintain service reliability. It enables quick response to issues, minimizes downtime, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement. In the upcoming modules, we will explore advanced incident management scenarios and strategies.
