# Exercise 1: Dockerizing Applications

In this exercise, you will practice containerization by Dockerizing an application. Containerization is a fundamental skill for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) to ensure consistent and portable deployments.

## Scenario

You have a simple web application that you want to containerize using Docker. The application is built using a specific runtime, and you want to package it as a Docker container for easy deployment.

## Instructions

1. Begin by setting up a development environment with Docker installed. Ensure you have a basic understanding of Docker commands and concepts.

2. Create a Dockerfile for the web application. Define the necessary steps to build a Docker image that includes the application code and runtime dependencies.

3. Build the Docker image using your Dockerfile.

4. Run a Docker container based on the image you created and verify that the application functions correctly.

5. Document the Dockerfile and any additional steps you took to containerize the application.

## Submission

Create a markdown file (e.g., `exercise1-dockerizing.md`) and document the process of Dockerizing the application, including the Dockerfile, build steps, and verification. Commit this file to your repository.
