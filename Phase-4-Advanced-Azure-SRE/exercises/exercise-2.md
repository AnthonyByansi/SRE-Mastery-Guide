# Exercise 2: Azure Cost Optimization

In this exercise, you will practice Azure cost optimization strategies to ensure efficient resource utilization and cost savings. Cost optimization is crucial for SREs to manage expenses effectively.

## Scenario

You are responsible for an Azure environment that includes virtual machines, databases, and other resources. Your goal is to implement cost optimization strategies that reduce unnecessary spending while maintaining performance.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have access to an Azure subscription and permissions to manage Azure resources.

2. Explore Azure Cost Management, which provides insights into resource costs and spending trends. Familiarize yourself with cost analysis, budgets, and recommendations.

3. Analyze the Azure resources in your environment to identify potential cost optimization opportunities. Consider areas such as:
   - Right-sizing virtual machines.
   - Identifying underutilized resources.
   - Implementing Azure Reserved Instances (RIs) for predictable workloads.
   - Evaluating serverless options for certain workloads.

4. Create a cost optimization plan that outlines specific actions to be taken to reduce costs.

5. Implement the identified cost optimization measures. This may involve resizing VMs, deallocating resources, or purchasing Azure RIs.

6. Monitor the impact of your cost optimization efforts using Azure Cost Management's reporting and tracking features.

7. Document the cost optimization plan, actions taken, and cost savings achieved.

## Submission

Create a markdown file (e.g., `exercise2-azure-cost-optimization.md`) and document the process of implementing Azure cost optimization strategies, including analysis, actions taken, and cost savings. Commit this file to your repository.
