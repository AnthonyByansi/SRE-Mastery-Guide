## Introduction

Scalability and cost optimization are critical aspects of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) in Azure. This module explores scalability principles, cost optimization strategies, and Azure tools to help SREs maintain performance while managing costs effectively.

## Scalability Principles

### Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances or nodes to distribute traffic and increase capacity. It improves fault tolerance and accommodates traffic spikes.

### Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of existing instances or nodes. It enhances the performance of individual resources.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Rightsizing Resources

Rightsizing involves adjusting resource allocations to match actual workload requirements. It prevents overprovisioning and reduces unnecessary costs.

### Reserved Instances

Reserved Instances allow you to commit to Azure resources for a specified period, offering significant cost savings compared to on-demand pricing.

### Serverless Architectures

Serverless architectures enable you to run code without managing infrastructure. You pay only for the resources used during execution.

## Azure Scaling and Cost Tools

### Azure Auto Scaling

Azure Auto Scaling automatically adjusts resources based on workload demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

### Azure Cost Management

Azure Cost Management provides visibility into resource costs and helps identify opportunities for cost optimization.

## Exercise: Implementing Auto Scaling and Cost Optimization

In this exercise, you will implement auto scaling for an Azure service and apply cost optimization strategies. You will use Azure Auto Scaling and Azure Cost Management to achieve better resource utilization and cost savings.

Instructions for the exercise can be found in the [Exercise: Implementing Auto Scaling and Cost Optimization](./exercise-scaling-cost.md) document.

## Conclusion

Scalability and cost optimization are integral to Azure SRE, enabling you to maintain performance while managing expenses efficiently. In the next modules, we will delve into advanced Azure SRE scenarios and best practices.
