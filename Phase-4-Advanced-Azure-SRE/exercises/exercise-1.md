# Exercise 1: Implementing Azure Security Policies

In this exercise, you will practice implementing Azure security policies to enforce security controls and compliance standards for your Azure resources. Security policies are vital for ensuring the protection of assets and adherence to regulatory requirements.

## Scenario

You are responsible for securing an Azure environment that includes virtual machines, databases, and storage accounts. Your goal is to implement Azure security policies that address common security vulnerabilities and compliance needs.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have access to an Azure subscription and the necessary permissions to create and manage security policies.

2. Explore Azure Policy, which allows you to define and enforce policies for your resources. Familiarize yourself with policy definitions, assignments, and effects.

3. Create Azure policies that enforce security controls such as:
   - Ensuring virtual machines have required security extensions enabled.
   - Enforcing strong password policies for Azure SQL databases.
   - Restricting public access to storage accounts.

4. Assign these policies to relevant Azure resource groups or subscriptions.

5. Monitor policy compliance using Azure Policy's built-in reporting and remediation capabilities.

6. Document the policies you created, the assignments, and any compliance results.

## Submission

Create a markdown file (e.g., `exercise1-azure-security-policies.md`) and document the process of implementing Azure security policies, including policy definitions, assignments, and compliance monitoring. Commit this file to your repository.
