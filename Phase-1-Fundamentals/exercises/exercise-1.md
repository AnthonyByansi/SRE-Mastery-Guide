# Exercise 1: Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

In this exercise, you will practice defining Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a hypothetical web service. SLOs are critical for setting the reliability expectations of a service and play a central role in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). 

## Instructions

1. Imagine you are responsible for a web service that provides online shopping functionality for a retail company. Define two SLOs for this service. Consider factors such as availability, latency, and error rates.

2. Write down the SLOs in a clear and measurable format. For example, "The service will have a monthly uptime of 99.9%."

3. Consider the trade-offs between setting aggressive SLOs and ensuring reliability. How might these SLOs impact user experience and engineering efforts?

4. Reflect on how these SLOs align with the principles of SRE and reliability engineering.

## Submission

Create a markdown file (e.g., `exercise1-slos.md`) and document your defined SLOs, trade-offs, and reflections. Commit this file to your repository.
